# Orientation Classifier - Machine Learning

This code was written for the course Elements of Artificial Intelligence (CSCI-B 551) at Indiana University handled by Professor David Crandall. Skeleton code was provided by the Professor to get us started with the assignment.


**What does the program do?** <br/>
* The program tries to find the degree in which the image is oriented.
* More details about the game can be found from this [link](https://github.com/manikandan5/ImageOrientation/blob/master/Question.pdf).

**How does it find it?** <br/>

* The program uses KNN and Neural Network to learn from the dataset and classify the images.

Detailed explanation about how the code works and the reason why we chose this implementation could be found [here](https://github.com/manikandan5/ImageOrientation/blob/master/Report.docx).
